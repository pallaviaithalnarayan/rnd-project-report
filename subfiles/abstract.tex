        Generating semantic segmentation ground truth for training deep learning models is a tidious job. Espececially manual annotations are needed which is time consuming.
        Synthetical dataset has started overtaking the manual process, wherein the segmentation can be captured using virtual environments using unreal, unity, or blender. 
        Microsoft have developed an AirSim plugin to be used in virtual environments which supports physics engine for car, drone and computer vision to move around the scene and capture the scene along with segmentation, depth etc. This data generation helps for training deep learning models by varying the environments which in real-time is time consuming. This approach of data generation helps in creating vast amount of data in varieties of dimensions such as height, size, various lighting conditions.
